🧪 Chemical Equipment Parameter Visualizer
Hybrid Web + Desktop Application

A hybrid analytics application that runs as both a Web Application and a Desktop Application, powered by a shared Django REST backend. The system processes CSV files containing chemical equipment data, performs analytical computations, visualizes results, maintains upload history, and generates PDF reports.

📌 Features

CSV upload via Web and Desktop

Data analytics using Pandas

Interactive charts (Chart.js & Matplotlib)

Upload history (last 5 datasets)

PDF report generation

Basic authentication (DRF)

Single backend for multiple frontends

🏗 Architecture
React (Web) ─┐
             ├── Django REST API ── SQLite
PyQt5 (Desktop) ┘


Both frontends consume the same backend APIs, ensuring consistency and reusability.
